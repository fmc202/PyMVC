# PyMVC
a python toolbox for minimum vetex cover problems
# this repository include 4 different algorithms for solving MVC

1. Exact algorithm: branch and bound
2. Approximate algorithm with greedy heuristic (combinning edge deletion and max degree greedy)
3. Two modified local search algorithms based on hill climbing


The approximate algorithm should be preferred as it gives the best trade-off between time and solution quality
