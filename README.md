# PyMVC
a python toolbox for minimum vetex cover problems
# this repository include 4 different algorithms for solving MVC

1. Exact algorithm: branch and bound
2. Approximate algorithm with greedy heuristic (combinning edge deletion and max degree greedy)
3. Two modified local search algorithms based on hill climbing

To use:
run the integrated.py which contains all methods

The original input data is not allowed to be disclosed according to the policy of the data publisher


The approximate algorithm should be preferred as it gives the best trade-off between time and solution quality
